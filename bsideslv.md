### BSidesLV Overview

The 11th annual [BSides Las Vegas](https://bsideslv.org) (or BSidesLV) conference will take place August 6-7, 2019 at the Tuscany Hotel & Casino. At about 3,000 participants, it is the smallest of the three conferences this week. Sometimes called the “Vegas Hacker Family Reunion,” because it draws the old school (who skip out on BlackHat), the new faces (there to learn), and everyone in between, in a warm and friendly environment. It is a 501(c)3 non-profit organization, organized and run by volunteers, funded by individual, corporate, and philanthropic donations. The first event in 2009 spawned a global movement, catalyzing events across the globe with over 300 conferences to date in over 26 countries.

The conference always has more demand than space, so for 2019 they’ve moved to a pre-reservation system. Those who donate before the event will get a badge, and the event is expected to reach capacity soon after the donations open. But don’t lose hope! The **I Am The Cavalry** and **Public Ground** tracks have hacked the badge system so anyone can join, and feature public policy topics.

***In their own words***
>BSides Las Vegas is an Information / Security conference that’s different. We’re a volunteer organized event, put on by and for the community, and we truly strive to keep information free.
>
>There is no charge to the public to attend BSidesLV. Our costs are covered by our generous donors and sponsors who share our vision of free dissemination of information.
>
>Presenters at our conference engage our participants and get the discussions started. There are no “attendees” at a BSides event. EVERYONE is a participant, adding something of value to the conversations.
>
>With tracks as diverse as “Common Ground”, focusing on non-tech issues of importance to the community; “Underground”, our Off-The-Record series that lets you delve deeper into the subjects that are better-off discussed offline; “Hire Ground”, our Career Track, focused on matching our Sponsors with participants looking for their next job, or career change; and “Proving Ground”, our mentorship program for first-time presenters; BSides Las Vegas strives to be a source of education, communication, and collaboration.

BSides Las Vegas consists of several themed tracks, several of which have unique formats. The three tracks of interest to the public policy community are **Hire Ground**, **I Am The Cavalry**, and **Public Ground**. Hire Ground, is organized by a Virginia-based company that organizes hiring events for federal government employees and contractors. **I Am The Cavalry** runs an eponymous track, focused on cybersecurity impacts on human life and public safety, frequently addressing topics of interest to policymakers and others. **Public Ground** is a space for public policy conversations and interactions, with in-depth conversations that bridge the gap between policy and technology communities.
