### Black Hat 2022
"Now in its 25th year, Black Hat USA is excited to present a unique hybrid event experience, offering the cybersecurity community a choice in how they wish to participate. Black Hat USA 2022 will open with four days of Trainings (August 6-11). The two-day main conference (August 10-11) featuring Briefings, Arsenal, Business Hall, and more will be a hybrid event—offering both a Virtual (online) Event and a Live, In-Person Event in Las Vegas."

### Black Hat Background

[Black Hat](https://blackhat.com/us-22) ([@BlackHatEvents](https://twitter.com/blackhatevents)) was created more than 20 years ago to provide security professionals a place to learn the very latest in information security risks, research and trends. The Black Hat conference was created in response to security professionals who, previously, were unable to attend DEFCON due to social stigma associated with the conference. Today, that is not the case. Two cultures prevail in both DEFCON and Black Hat, and Black Hat is viewed as the corporate junior to it’s older, free-spirited sibling.

The conference offers two sections - Briefings and Trainings, and is viewed as a corporate security conference unlike DEFCON. Each year, internationally leading security researchers take the stage to share their latest work and exploits in a friendly, vendor-neutral environment. Vulnerabilities are often exposed that impact everything from popular consumer devices to critical international infrastructure and everything in between. Black Hat seeks groundbreaking research to fill both 25 and 50-minute speaking slots for each annual show.

Black Hat Trainings offer attendees individual technical courses on topics ranging from the latest in penetration testing to exploiting web applications and even defending and building SCADA systems. Often designed exclusively for Black Hat, these hands-on attack and defense courses are taught by industry and subject matter experts from all over the world with the goal of defining and defending tomorrow's information security landscape.

From its inception in 1997, Black Hat has grown from a single annual conference in Las Vegas to a conference series held annually in the United States, Europe and Asia.

### Black Hat Health Policy
At this time, BlackHat has no requirements for vaccinations, masks, or other health measures. Attendees are advised to consider their personal health needs. [Learn more](https://www.blackhat.com/code-of-conduct.html)
